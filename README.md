## 4. Experimental Procedure

### Step 1: Virtual Machine Configuration

The virtual machines were configured using comparable resource allocations.

#### Proxmox VE

* Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS guest
* 2 vCPU
* 2 GB RAM
* 20 GB virtual disk
* Proxmox VE / KVM virtualization

#### VMware Workstation

* Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS guest
* 2 vCPU
* 2 GB RAM
* 20 GB virtual disk
* VMware Workstation virtualization

### Step 2: System Configuration Verification

The following commands were used inside the Ubuntu guest systems:

```bash
hostnamectl
lscpu
free -h
df -h
top
```

These commands were used to verify:

| Command       | Purpose                                    |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `hostnamectl` | Operating system and system information    |

| `free -h`     | RAM and swap information                   |
| `df -h`       | Disk-space information                     |
| `top`         | Real-time system and process monitoring    |

### Step 3: Sysbench Installation

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install sysbench -y
```

### Step 4: Verify Sysbench

```bash
sysbench --version
```

### Step 5: Execute CPU Benchmark

The same benchmark command was executed in both virtual machines:

```bash
sysbench cpu --cpu-max-prime=20000 run
```

The same workload was used in both environments to allow comparison of the measured performance.

## 7. Metric Explanations & Visualizations

### Performance Metric Definitions

1. **Total Execution Time:** The wall-clock duration required to execute the Sysbench workload.

2. **Total Events:** The total number of benchmark operations completed during the test.

3. **Events per Second (EPS):** The number of benchmark operations completed per second. This represents the measured throughput for the workload.

4. **Latency:** The time required to complete an individual benchmark operation.

   * **Minimum Latency:** Fastest recorded operation.
   * **Average Latency:** Average time per operation.
   * **Maximum Latency:** Slowest recorded operation.

## 8. Technical Analysis & Discussion

### 1. CPU Throughput

The Sysbench benchmark recorded:

* **Proxmox VE:** 1,689.43 events/sec
* **VMware Workstation:** 983.84 events/sec

The measured throughput differed between the two virtualization environments under the tested configuration.

### 2. Total Events

During the approximately 10-second benchmark:

* **Proxmox VE:** 16,903 events
* **VMware Workstation:** 9,842 events

The total number of completed events therefore differed between the two experimental environments.

### 3. Latency

The measured average latency was:

* **Proxmox VE:** 0.59 ms
* **VMware Workstation:** 1.02 ms

The measured maximum latency was:

* **Proxmox VE:** 1.09 ms
* **VMware Workstation:** 4.38 ms

These measurements show that the latency characteristics differed between the two tested environments.

### 4. Execution Time

The execution times were:

* **Proxmox VE:** 10.0006 seconds
* **VMware Workstation:** 10.0010 seconds

The difference in total execution time was very small because the Sysbench benchmark operated for approximately the same duration in both environments.

### 5. Factors Affecting the Results

The measured performance can be influenced by several factors:

* Hypervisor architecture
* Host operating-system overhead
* CPU scheduling
* Host background workload
* VM resource allocation
* Virtual-machine configuration
* Software configuration
* Physical hardware characteristics

Therefore, the results represent the behavior observed in this particular experimental setup and should not be treated as universal performance values for all Proxmox VE or VMware Workstation installations.

---

## 9. Conclusion & Engineering Takeaways

### Conclusion

This experiment provided a practical comparison between a Type-1 virtualization environment using Proxmox VE and a Type-2 virtualization environment using VMware Workstation.

Both environments used comparable Ubuntu virtual-machine resources and the same Sysbench CPU workload.

Under the tested conditions, differences were observed in:

* Total events
* Events per second
* Minimum latency
* Average latency
* Maximum latency

The measured execution times remained almost identical.

### Engineering Takeaways

1. **Virtualization architecture matters:** Different virtualization architectures can produce different measured performance characteristics.

2. **Resource standardization is important:** Using comparable vCPU, RAM, disk, and benchmark settings makes the comparison more meaningful.

3. **Throughput and latency provide complementary information:** Events/sec shows workload throughput, while latency describes the time taken by individual operations.

4. **Benchmark results depend on experimental conditions:** Hardware, host workload, VM configuration, and software versions can affect measured results.

5. **A benchmark should be interpreted within its scope:** The values obtained in this experiment describe the tested environment and workload rather than every possible deployment.
